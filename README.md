# prank-batch
I made this for a friend who wanted to "prank" someone, and it worked. This is entirely harmless (for the most part), and worst case scenario you will just have to restart your pc to stop the program.

---

### How to use:

- Rename `prank.bat` to something your friend would actually click on.
- Put the `.bat` file into a `.ZIP` folder
- Send it to your friend
- Have them open it, and follow the instructions

---

### FAQ:

- Q: Why do I have to put it into a `.ZIP` folder?
- A: Windows will detect random bat files as Virus's when not compressed in a `.ZIP` file / folder.
